        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>!DOCTYPE html declaration tells the browser what document type to expect; declarations 			are not case-sensitive.
          </li>
          <li>Element - refers to the entire element from opening tag to closing tag.
          </li>
          <li>Tag - refers to what appears inside the angle brackets.
          </li>
          <li>Attribute - defines additional information about an element; always defined at the beginning 			element, never the closing element.
          </li>
          <li>Child elements - elements that are nested inside other elements; element holders are parent 			elements.
          </li>
          <li>Semantic HTML elements - the name of the element describes its content and the role it plays 			on a webpage; makes HTML easier to read by other developers and the browser; also 			plays an important role in accessibility.
          </li>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section class="card" id="css-section">
        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Selector - defines the element or attributes to which the rules, or declarations, will apply.</li>
          <li>Declaration - contains two important components: the CSS property we want to apply and the value of that property.</li>
          <li>Margin - indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element; not visible on a page, just acts as a buffer.</li>
          <li>Padding - adds space around the content inside an element; makes the entire element bigger.</li>
          <li>* selector - applies a rule to all the elements visible on a page.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section class="card" id="git-section">
        <h2>Git</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>git status - checks what branch we are currently on.</li>
          <li>git checkout -b branch-name - creates a new branch and switches to it.</li>
          <li>git add -A - stages changes; selects all files in the working branch to commit.</li>
          <li>git commit -m "added code to HTML file" - commits the changes (-m adds a message)</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section class="card" id="javascript-section">
        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
          <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
          <li>Comments - snippets of text that can be added along with the code; browser ignores text marked as comments</li>
          <li>Operator - mathematical symbol that produces a result based on two vales (or variables)</li>
          <li>Conditionals - code structures used to test if an expression returns true or not; a very common form of conditionals is the if…else statement</li>
          <li>Arrays - a single variable that is used to hold a group of related data; regular objects for which there is a particular relationship between integer-keyed properties and the length property; perfect candidate to represent ordered lists; can store different types of data such as strings, numbers, etc.</li>
          <li>Functions - ways of packaging functionality that you wish to reuse; possible to define a body of code as a function that executes when you call the function name in your code; good alternative to repeatedly writing the same code; functions look like variable names but are followed by parentheses ()</li>
        </ul>
