# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

I created this webpage as a study guide to the bootcamp prework learning sessions. I wanted an easy way to access notes for the HTML, CSS, git, and JavaScript lessons. I did this by learning and using basic HTML, CSS, git, and JavaScript.

This Study Guide can be used to access notes on HTML, CSS, git, and JavaScript. If you open the DevTools console, you can see the JavaScript running. It will list the topics we learned from the prework sessions and choose one topic for us to study first.
